interface IMethods
{
	void method1();
	void method2();
	void method3();
	void method4();
}
 
class derived : IMethods
{
	void method1(){........some logic.....}
	void method2(){........some logic.....}
	void method3(){........some logic.....}
	void method4(){........some logic.....}
	void method5(){........some logic.....}
	void method6(){........some logic.....}
}
 
derived d =  new derived();
IMethods instance =  new derived();

what is the output?


public sealed className {

private className _className;

private className(){}

public className GetclassName(){

if(_className is null){
_className = new className();
} 

return _className;

}

}

What is the need of sealed class in a singleton pattern ?
  if you have a private constructor then sub classes cannot inherit the base class

How do you manage errors in the endpoint ?


how do you register a service in asp.net ?

can we have two classses implementing the same interface be registered ?
yes, this will work and the class which was last regiestered will be injected in the respective controllers.
for ex:

            builder.Services.AddTransient<ITestService, TestClass>();
            builder.Services.AddTransient<ITestService, TestService>();

	TestService class will be injected 

what is the authentication mechanism you are currently using ?
